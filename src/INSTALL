ukb needs boost version 1.44 or higher to compile. Specifically, UKB needs the
following Boost libraries:

      * boost graph library
      * boost program options 
      * boost filesystem
      * boost tokenizer
      * boost lexical cast
      * boost numeric conversions
      * boost asio

if you need to compile the boost libraries yourself, you should to call the
'bootstrap.sh' script and then use b2 with the --layout=system option.

% ./bootstrap.sh
% ./b2 install --layout=system

If you have boost properly installed, just run by the standard compilation
procedure:

# Check dependencies and generate Makefile

% ./configure 

# the ./configure script has some options (./configure --help to see them
# all). The important options are:
#
#  --prefix
#             path were the executables will be installed (after 'make
#             install')
#
#  --with-boost-include
#            path were the Boost include files reside (default is
#            /usr/include)
#
#  --with-boost-lib
#            path were the Boost library files reside (default is /usr/lib)
#
#  --enable-static
#            Enable static linkage

# Compile 

% make

# The executables are now in the current directory. Now, if you want
# to install them on a different location (set by the --prefix option
# of ./configure), just 'cp' them, or execute

% make install
